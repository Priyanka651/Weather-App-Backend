#  Weather App — Full-Stack Project (Frontend + Backend)
Built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Designed for the PM Accelerator — AI Engineer Intern Technical Assessment

A full-stack weather forecasting application that lets users search weather by location, fetch a 5-day forecast, get current location weather, store results in a database, update and delete records, export weather data, and benefit from intelligent features like autocomplete suggestions, dynamic date validation, and Google Maps integration.

# The project demonstrates:
- Frontend engineering (Tech Assessment #1)
- Backend engineering (Tech Assessment #2)
- API integrations
- Database persistence
- CRUD operations
- Data export
- Error handling
